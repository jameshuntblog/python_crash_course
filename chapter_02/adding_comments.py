message = f"The Second Coming by {famous_person}:\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
