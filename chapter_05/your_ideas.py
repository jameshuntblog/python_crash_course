# Today I was thinking about a program that personal budgeting program that
# takes all of your expenses, amortizes the monthly ones, and provides you with
# an estimated daily spend. It could also have a weekly average, monthly
# average, rolling 3-month average, and rolling 6-month average, and rolling
# 1-year average to see how you compare. It might also have tagable categories 
# of spend so you can see the areas where you are spending.
